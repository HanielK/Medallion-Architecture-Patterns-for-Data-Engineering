DA Track Training Labs
Bronze → Silver → Gold Architecture in Databricks

Weather + Outages + Work Orders

Overview

Welcome to the Data Analytics Track Training Labs.

This repository teaches a practical, production-style Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) in Databricks using realistic, messy operational datasets.

You will work with:

Weather data (Open-Meteo API)

Operational outage feeds

Work order management data

By the end of this track, you will be able to design, clean, model, and analyze operational datasets using a clean layered architecture suitable for BI dashboards and advanced analytics.

What You Will Learn

You will:

Ingest raw messy data into Bronze

Clean and normalize data into Silver

Build analytics-ready fact and dimension tables in Gold

Implement data quality validation and governance flags

Join operational data to weather datasets

(Bonus) Perform nearest-hour weather joins for advanced causal analysis

Build a production-style analytics dashboard in Databricks SQL
